Polymer Simulation's class documentation
==============================================
This is the documentation of a `python` class for generating polymer simulations LAMMPS scripts.

The simulations two kind of systems are generated by this class. One is the simulation of polymer chains 
diffusing in a matrix of moving spheres, and the other kind is the simulation of polymer chains diffusing in empty space. 


This class can be accesed and downloaded in this `link <https://github.com/ThiElf/polymer-in-simulation>`_.
